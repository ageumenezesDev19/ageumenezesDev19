# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ageumenezesDev19, a Technology Enthusiast
- ðŸ“— I am currently studying at Trybe;
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development, Design, Motion Design and Soft Skills;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git, GitHub, Html, CSS, JavaScript, Programming logic,
     soft skills such as emotional intelligence and communication;
     
       Also Iâ€™m learning Adobe Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Affects too,
       but not as intense as the first ones, 
     
       because my biggest focus
       is on programming now.

- ðŸŽ¬ I really enjoy watching science fiction, animation and adventure movies;
- ðŸŽµ Furthermore, I love listening to international and electronic music.
