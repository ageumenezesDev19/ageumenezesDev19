- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ageumenezesDev19, a Technology Enthusiast;
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Development, Design, Motion Design and Soft Skills;
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git, GitHub, Html, Programming logic,
     soft skills such as emotional intelligence and communication;
     
       Also Adobe Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Affects too,
       but not as intense as the first ones, 
     
       because my biggest focus
       is on programming now.

- ðŸŽ¬ I really enjoy watching science fiction, animation and adventure movies;
- ðŸŽµ Furthermore, I love listening to electronic music.
